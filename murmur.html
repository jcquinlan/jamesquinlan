<!-- I like to keep a pretty neat codebase, and do my best to ensure
I use semantically natural class and id names. Take a look at the code
to see what I'm used to building, and keep in mind that I'm always
open to learning new workflows. -->

          <p>I decided to become involved with Android app development after experimenting with Java and Processing.
            I ended up partnering with a Java developer to build our first app, entitled Murmur. I was inspired by the flocking
            of starling as a defensive manuever and thought that to control a flock would be an interesting game mechanic for our
            first application. I was also inspired by cellular biology, in which the circle of life is simplified; kill or be killed.
            These are a few of the mockups that I have made pre-release of v1.0.</p>
